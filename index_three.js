// YOU DON'T NEED COMMENTS IF YOU WRITE CLEAN CODE
// HOWEVER THE ABOVE STATENT IS A PULLSH
// SOMETIMES YOU WRITE COMMENTS BECAUSE CODE CAN DESCRIBE HOW, BUT IT CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY
// USES OF COMMENTS
// (i) What is the why
// (ii) Clarify what is not typically legible by humans
// WHO IS SMART? WE ARE!
// WHO WRITES CLEAN CODE? WE DO!
// LEVEL UP IN DIFFERENT WAYS BECAUSE THE CODE WHICH I THOUGHT WAS CLEAN 5 YEARS AGO IS NO LONGER THAT WAY
// SOMETIMES WE ARE ALL KNOWLEDGEABLE IN DIFFERENT WAYS
// IF YOU ARE IN A TEAM WHERE EVERYBODY'S SKILL SET IS MORE TIGHTLY KNIT YOU CAN BE IN THE SAME PAGE
// IN SOME TEAMS, THE SKILL SETS ARE MORE OF A VENN DIAGRAM, YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE SAME OPINIONS OR BACKGROUNDS. IN MOST CASES, SUCH TEAMS HAVE A GREATER GROUND
// (iii) Comments can be like chapters of a book -> So that you can scheme easier and pick things up faster
// Sections of code allows people to get to the piece that is most relevant to them
// (iv) A guide to keep the logic straight while writing the code so that you can break down your tasks into smaller bits 
// Remove them later
// FOR EXAMPLE;
// get the request from the server
// give us an error if it failed
// do x thing with that request
// format the data like so
// (v) This is okay to refactor
// this isn't my best work 
// but we had to get it in by the deadline
// (vi) Commenting as a teaching tool -> Keep yourself accountable for what you are learning
// (vii) Stack Overflowed code
// Senior Engineers should help team be as productive as possible and improve the scalablity of code
