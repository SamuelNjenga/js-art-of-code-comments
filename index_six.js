// What makes a GOOD comment?
// (i) Short and concise -> Easy to maintain. In most cases it should not exceed one line.

// (ii) Provides value.
// Informative Comment
// format dd/mm/yy or dd-mm-yyyy or dd.mm.yyyy

// (iii) Clarifies code that has a business purpose but looks out of sort. For example there might be some domain knowledge in the system that some new developers may not be familiar with

// (iv) Sometimes a warning or amplification of importance -> Do this to protect ourselves or provide the function that's needed
// For example:
// outstanding issue when UI layer is injecting empty characters. DO NOT remove TRIM()

// (v) Legal Comments -> Used when working with Open Source projects
// For example:
/**
 * This uses ROS Library 1.x.x and my organization assumes all risks in doing so.
 * This comment is mandated by the license to use ROS Library 2022.

/* SUMMARY */
// Good code is Self-Documenting and Professional Programming Means Commenting

// KEY REASONS FOR WRITING COMMENTS IN YOUR CODE:
// -COMMUNICATION
// -CLARITY
// -EXPLANATION

// TYPES OF CODE COMMENTS
// -DOCUMENTATION COMMENTS -> Quickly clarifies the purpose why this code.
// -FUNCTION COMMENTS -> It explains the function well.
// -LOGIC COMMENTS -> It explains the logic of clarifying complex code paths.

// TIPS FOR QUALITY PROFESSIONAL COMMENTS:
// (i) Write comments while writing code so that you will remember.
// (ii) Write short, informative comments, since if you can't write a clear comment, there may be a problem with the code.
// Your comment should not create confusion, it should disappear confusion.
// (iii) Write down why you are doing something.
// (iv) Add comments while fixing bugs because sometimes fixing an issue may generate other issues as well
// (v) Don't refer to other documents or comments
// A useless comment or a comment that does not add or generate any value should be ommited. Ignore this type of comment.
